# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in the readme](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/README.md)

To add a new changeset, run `npx changeset` in the root of the repository.
